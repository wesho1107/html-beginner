    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are a few secrets to the best classic, chewy chocolate chip cookies. Number one: Don’t use chips; instead,
        opt for a mix of milk or semisweet and dark chocolate chunks. The second is to let the dough rest overnight or
        longer for a more complex, toffee-like flavor. Lastly, use an ice cream scooper to get even-sized cookies every
        time. And that’s it! With these little tweaks, the result is a cookie that’s textured on the outside, and soft
        and gooey on the inside. Absolutely perfect!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks</li>
        <li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while
            before falling back into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which
            would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like
            flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor
            will be.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches
            (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies
            can spread evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
        <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
